# Spinning cube

This a non trivial example that demonstrates the use of
[Gorgasm](https://github.com/remogatto/gorgasm) to build Android
native applications. It shows a rotating cube shaded with a
texture. Swipe on the screen to rotate the model.

The example is shipped with a simple helper package named
<tt>cubelib</tt>. Package <tt>cubelib</tt> provides a naive
abstraction of the 3d world with some helper functions. The aim is to
show how to integrate an higher level package on the base framework.

# Usage

To run the application simply issue the following command:

<pre>
gotask run xorg # or
gotask run android
</pre>
